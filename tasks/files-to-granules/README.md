# @cumulus/files-to-granule

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nasa/cumulus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nasa/cumulus)

This lambda function converts array-of-files input payloads into granule object output payloads.
It is primarily intended to support the standard output of a [cumulus-process](https://github.com/nasa/cumulus-process-py) task,
and convert that output into a granule object accepted as input by the majority of other Cumulus tasks.

## What is Cumulus?
