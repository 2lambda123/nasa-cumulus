## Running Locally

Run this to start the application. It will specify which port it's listening on.

`npm start`

You can also start it in debug mode:

`npm run start-debug`

This will output a message like

```
To start debugging, open the following URL in Chrome:
    chrome-devtools://devtools/bundled/inspector.html?experiments=true&v8only=true&ws=127.0.0.1:9229/bae74702-93c5-44dd-ab30-fe29a9bddbb9
```

Open up Chrome to that URL and then you can use Chrome dev tools to set break points
