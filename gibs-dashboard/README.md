## Deploy

Deploying requires two stack names.

1. Dashboard stack name - The name of the dashboard client itself.
2. GIBs Ops API stack name - The name of the stack used for deploying the GIBS Ops API. This is used to determine and configure the URL to use when talking to the API.

It also requires that the gibs-ops-api is checked out in a local directory.

Run the following with both specified stack names.

`bin/deploy.sh xx-gibs-dashboard xx-gibs-api`
