## AWS Long Term Access Key

### Create & Generate AWS Access Key

For instructions on how to create and generate a AWS Long Term Access Key via CloudTamer go to [Get Access Keys Through CloudTamer](https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/ESKB/Get+Access+Keys+Through+CloudTamer).

> **Tip:** Keep in mind that CloudTamer only allows 2 AWS API Keys to be stored. If you encounter the error that you already have 2 AWS API Keys then you will have to select "remove" on one of the keys. Then retry to add another key.
