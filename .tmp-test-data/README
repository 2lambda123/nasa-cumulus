The http and sftp containers managed by docker-compose.yml will serve out any
files in this directory.  The intention is that any files being fetched using
http or sftp should be copied into this directory (probably under a
subdirectory), fetched, and then deleted.

The docker containers defined in docker-compose.yml are used for testing.
